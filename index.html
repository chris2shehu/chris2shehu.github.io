    <p class="home_body">I am a Data Engineer with a wealth of experience in the tech industry. My career has spanned a diverse range of roles including Reporting Analyst, Ambulatory Analyst, Tech Support Agent, Computer Operator, Forensics Intern, and 3D Designer. This breadth of experience has provided me with a unique perspective on the industry and the ability to approach problems from multiple angles.

My expertise includes working with ETL processes, Data Lakes, and Machine Learning Models, as well as building and using APIs. I am proficient in SQL and Python and continually strive to stay abreast of new technologies. My goal is always to leverage these tools and skills to deliver creative and competitive solutions for my customers.

One of my core beliefs is that technology, when used effectively, should make things easier, not more complicated. This principle guides my work, and I am always looking for ways to simplify processes and make the user experience more effortless.

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy studying and spending time with my family. I believe that a balanced life is key to sustained productivity and creativity in the workplace.

My tech stack includes Azure, Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lakes, Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, Azure Functions, Python (Pandas, Spark). These tools empower me to address a wide range of data engineering challenges and deliver high-quality results.

As you consider your data engineering needs, I invite you to consider how my skills and experience could benefit your team. I am confident that together, we can navigate the complex world of data and achieve outstanding results.</p>
